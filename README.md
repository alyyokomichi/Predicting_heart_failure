# Heart Failure Prediction
Dataset used in this work was obtained from Kaggle, produced by Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman. Article "Machine learning can predict heart failure patient survival with serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone" published in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, 20, 16 (2020).

## Introduction
Heart failure is a common event caused by cardiovascular diseases, that can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


## Objective
Analyze the dataset and use machine learning model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.
